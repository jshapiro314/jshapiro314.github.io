            <h3>Description:</h3>
            <p class="text-justify" contenteditable="true">The Manishtushu Cruciform is a stone monument that stands 22 cm tall and
              about 11 cm wide and long. Shaped like a cross, the twelve sides of this
              cruciform are engraved with Akkadian writing. It purports to be a grant
              from King Manishtushu to the temples in Sippar. This engraving was originally
              found during a British excavation in Sippar, Iraq during 1881.</p>
            <h3>Purported Time Period:</h3>
            <p class="text-justify" contenteditable="true">Around 2200 BCE</p>
            <h3>Actual Time Period:</h3>
            <p class="text-justify" contenteditable="true">600 BCE</p>
            <h3>Provenance:</h3>
            <p class="text-justify">The artifact was found during a British excavation in 1881, and has been
              in The British Museum ever since.</p>

            <h1 class="text-primary">Evidence of Forgery</h1>
            <p class="text-justify">Though the text appears to be proper ancient Akkadian, studies have shown
              that some words used were not present in the language until one thousand
              years later. Additionally, a copy of the same text was recovered near by
              during the excavation. However, this copy was written in correct Neo-Babylonian
              Akkadian. When comparing the two artifacts side by side, the word order
              stays the same and some words from the Neo-Babylonian copy are present
              in the cruciform. This is interesting because the word order and word choice
              violates the convention of ancient Akkadian but is correct for Neo-Babylonian
              Akkadian. For these reasons, it is assumed that the cruciform is a poor
              translation of the newer text. This implies that though the cruciform seems
              to be from 2200 BCE, it must have actually been created around 600 BCE
              and is therefore a forgery.</p>

            <h1 class="text-primary">Profile of Likely Forger</h1>
            <p class="text-justify">Though we do not know the exact name of the forger, by studying the cruciform
              and analyzing the motives we can deduce the group of people responsible
              for the forgery. This monument was purportedly found by priests in 600
              BCE during temple renovations. The text on the cruciform highlights the
              numerous gifts King Manishtushu provides to the temple at Sippar. These
              gifts include land, money, and releasing the temple from mandatory government
              work. Looking at who benefits from this decree, we can assume that the
              priests in the temples at Sippar were responsible for the forgery. They
              would have pretended this document was lost in time, and the current king
              would have to give the temple the gifts it did not receive from 2200 BCE
              to the present (600 BCE). It is unclear if the temple priests succeeded
              in fooling the king.</p>

            <p class="text-justify">The Manishtushu Cruciform is an interesting piece because it disproves
              the notion that forgeries are a relatively modern invention. It shows that
              even four thousand years ago individuals were faking artifacts for their
              own gain. Though this piece may not be real, it is still a unique historical
              artifact with a colorful history.</p>
