            <h3>Description:</h3>
            <p class="text-justify">In Licking County, Ohio, in 1860, David Wyrick found in an ancient earthwork “a stone casket eighteen inches long and twelve inches wide.” The casket contained a slab of stone with a priestly human figure on one side with “Moses” written in Hebrew above it. The Ten Commandments, written in Hebrew, covered the stone. The second, third, fourth, and fifth commandments were shortened.</p>
            <h3>Purported Time Period:</h3>
            <p class="text-justify">100 B.C.E. - 500 C.E</p>
            <h3>Actual Time Period:</h3>
            <p class="text-justify">Unknown, but likely 1850s</p>
            <h3>Provenance:</h3>
            <p class="text-justify"> Discovered by David Wyrick in 1860, sold to David M. Johnson of Coshocton</p>
            <h3>Current Location:</h3>
            <p class="text-justify">Johnson-Humrickhouse Museum, Coshocton, Ohio</p>

            <p class="text-justify">The letters “resembled no known Hebrew script” and the same letters were inconsistent on the piece. The errors in letters were so bad that one scholar, Dr. Abraham Geiger, referred to the piece as “religious hocus-pocus.” The letters appeared to be stretched or shortened as necessary to fit on one line, which was not common practice. After Wyrick’s death, slate with attempts at Hebrew letters were found, as was a “copy of the wood cut of Moses...chiseled on the stone.”

            <p class="text-justify">David Wyrick was a printer by trade who had an interest in ancient languages and archeology. Before the Newark Decalogue was found, Wyrick had unearthed a similar stone in the same location. This was a small wedge-shaped stone with four inscriptions, reading as follows: “King of the earth”, “Holy of Holies”, “the Law of the Lord”, “the Word of the Lord”. That discovery prompted him to gather a group of men to dig for more artifacts in that ancient earthwork. The letters of the first stone did not appear to be ancient and the stone itself did not appear to be old. It is unclear whether David Wyrick created this forgery and the Decalogue forgery, but many suspect he did.

            <p class="text-justify">If this piece were authentic, it could have been evidence of a lost tribe of Israel living in America during the period of the Moundbuilders, around 100 B.C.E. to 500 C.E. The authenticity of this piece would have provided a connection from the history of the United States of America to the history of Jerusalem and the Holy Land. Americans who deeply wanted to be important and connected to biblical history were swept away by this find.</p>
