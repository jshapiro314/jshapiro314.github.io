            <h3>Description:</h3>
            <p class="text-justify">The Ya’akov Ossuary is a small stone box with an Aramaic inscription that says “James, son of Joseph, brother of Jesus.” It appears to be an ossuary containing the bones of Jesus Christ’s brother James. The box itself is twenty inches long and is dated to between the first century B.C.E. and the first century C.E. The publication of the Ya’akov Ossuary caused quite a bit of excitement as it was believed to be the first written reference to Jesus Christ.</p>
            <h3>Purported Time Period:</h3>
            <p class="text-justify">1st century CE</p>
            <h3>Actual Time Period:</h3>
            <p class="text-justify">Unknown, but perhaps late 1900s or early 2000s</p>
            <h3>Provenance:</h3>
            <p class="text-justify">Oded Golan owned this piece.</p>
            <h3>Current Location:</h3>
            <p class="text-justify">Israel</p>

            <p class="text-justify">The first half of the inscription (“James, son of Joseph”) does not match the second half of the inscription (“brother of Jesus”) in terms of depth, clarity, and kerning. It appears to be written by two different people, even to the untrained eye. A committee of scholars appointed by the Israel Antiquities Authority declared the “brother of Jesus” inscription to be a forgery in 2003. The Ya’akov Ossuary was not discovered during an official dig, but appeared on the antiquities market one day. It is likely that the box itself is authentic, and it may be that the first half of the inscription is authentic. It is certain that the second half of the inscription is authentic, which means that this ossuary could hold the bones of anyone named James with a father named Joseph.</p>

            <p class="text-justify">Oded Golan is an antiquities collector in Jerusalem. He has a passion for archeology and discovered the world’s oldest dictionary at age 10. During investigation of the Ya’akov Ossuary, the police found an antiquities workshop in Golan’s apartment and an even larger antiquities workshop in Golan’s storage unit. Golan denied accusations of forgery.</p>

            <p class="text-justify">The inscription “James, son of Joseph, brother of Jesus” could have been the first written reference to Jesus Christ. The questionable provenance of this piece and the evidence pointing to forgery, however, reveals that it is extremely unlikely that this piece is authentic. This piece lead to the “forgery trial of the century,” in which Oded Golan was charged with 44 counts of fraud and forgery, although he was ultimately acquitted after seven years of trial.</p>
