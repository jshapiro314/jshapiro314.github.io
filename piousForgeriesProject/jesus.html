            <h3>Description:</h3>
            <p class="text-justify">Jesus’ Wife Papyrus is a 1.5 in by 3 in fragment of papyrus with eight incomplete lines of coptic writing. The text states that Jesus had a wife and she was able to be a disciple. This simple statement would force the Catholic church to reconsider how they view female clergy, virginity, the roles of women in the church. Harvard professor Karen King received the forgery from a man named Walter Fritz. After careful examination and research King presented the fragment at the International Congress of Coptic Studies in September 2012. Shortly after, the fragment was discovered to be a forgery.</p>
            <h3>Purported Time Period:</h3>
            <p class="text-justify">4th century CE</p>
            <h3>Actual Time Period:</h3>
            <p class="text-justify">Present Day
</p>
            <h3>Provenance:</h3>
            <p class="text-justify">Originally it was thought that Walter Fritz received the papyrus from an anonymous owner who acquired the fragment in 1997. This owner purchased it along with other documents from a german-american collector who first got the document in the 1960s while in East Germany. In 2016, this turned out to be false. In reality Fritz had the papyrus the whole time, and then gave it to Professor King. It is likely Fritz was the forger.</p>

            <h1 class="text-primary">Evidence of Forgery</h1>
            <p class="text-justify">While Karen King researched the papyrus before announcing her discovery, her research was not thorough. There were a handful of signs that point to the document being a forgery. First, King believed Fritz’s story at face value regarding how he acquired the piece. She never properly followed the paper trail to see if Fritz may have been lying. As Fritz was a shady character, it would have been in her best interest to investigate the provenance of the artifact. Second, King put too much value in the scientific tests used to date the papyrus. Though the ink and papyrus tested ancient, it would not have been impossible for a forger to get an ancient piece of blank papyrus or create ink out of ancient carbon remains. Additionally, during the carbon dating test the cleaning protocol had to be interrupted, so the accuracy was questionable. Third, King should have recognized the poorly formed Coptic letters were probably due to an inexperienced forger copying them down from a script chart. Instead, she simply believed that an inexperienced scribe could have written the text. Finally, King should have confirmed the authenticity with other academics before going public. While she did speak to a couple, it would have helped immensely if she had reached out to more experts. Unfortunately because of these mistakes, Professor King’s career was ruined and she had to concede the artifact was forged.

            <h1 class="text-primary">Profile of Likely Forger</h1>
            <p class="text-justify">The papyrus fragment was most likely forged by the individual who gave it to Professor King in the first place -- Walter Fritz. Little was known about the man until 2016 when Ariel Sabar published an article about him in The Atlantic. Fritz was a shady character who had the background to create such a forgery. He studied Egyptology, headed the Stasi Museum, and was an antiquities scholar. He studied Coptic and briefly studied architecture. With these skills he was more than capable of forging the artifact. His architectural skills could help with drawing the Coptic letters, and his study of the language would make it simple to create the translation. The only missing piece was motivation, and that still isn’t completely clear. The forgery was not for financial gain. Instead, it seemed that Fritz simply wanted to discredit the Church (as he had issues with it ever since childhood) and see if he could trick experts. For a brief time it seemed as if Fritz succeeded in his goals, but the papyrus was eventually discovered as a forgery. </p>

            <h1 class="text-primary">Significance</h1>
            <p class="text-justify">If the Jesus’ Wife Papyrus was real, it would have forced the Catholic Church to reconsider some of its foundational beliefs. Female clergy would be allowed, virginity would not be required for priests, and women's roles would drastically change. This document would have effectively redefined the Catholic faith.
