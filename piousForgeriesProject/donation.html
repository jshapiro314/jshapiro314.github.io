            <h3>Description:</h3>
            <p class="text-justify">The Donation of Constantine claims to be a document commissioned by Emperor
              Constantine I of the Roman Empire. It describes Constantine’s conversion
              to Christianity after being cured of his leprosy by Pope Sylvester I. In
              a show of appreciation, Constantine gifts the Catholic church with the
              entire western Roman Empire.</p>
            <h3>Purported Time Period:</h3>
            <p class="text-justify">4th century CE</p>
            <h3>Actual Time Period:</h3>
            <p class="text-justify">Around 8th century CE</p>
            <h3>Provenance:</h3>
            <p class="text-justify">This document had been circulating around in the Catholic church since
              about the 8th century AD, but was first cited by Pope Leo IX in the 11th
              century CE. The oldest known copy of the Donation of Constantine has been
              dated back to the 9th century CE.</p>
            <h3>Current Location:</h3>
            <p class="text-justify">There are no known copies of the document accessible today.</p>

            <h1 class="text-primary">Evidence of Forgery</h1>
            <p class="text-justify">In the 15th century, Lorenzo Valla, a scholar with extensive knowledge
              of Classic Latin published his work De falso credita et ementita Constantini
              Donatione declamatio, which declared the Donation a forgery. He appealed
              first to a sense of logic, to say that Constantine, a powerful emperor,
              would never give away his hard earned land, and that Sylvester would not
              be comfortable accepting such a large donation. The historical record shows
              no evidence of the donation ever having occurred, despite its momentous
              nature. Valla’s knowledge of Classical Latin also allowed him to expose
              the later origin of the piece. The Donation had obvious philological anachronisms
              that dated the Latin to a much later 8th century CE. Besides this, the
              Latin errors present in the document were not typical of good scribes,
              like those who would write for the emperor. All evidence points to the
              fact that this donation never occurred and is the work of someone centuries
              removed from the reign of Constantine.</p>

            <p class="text-justify">This document was likely created by someone within the church hoping to
              enhance the power of the papacy. Many suggest the document was forged during
              the reign of Pope Stephen II, hoping to establish precedent for a donation
              from Pepin, King of the Franks.</p>

            <h1 class="text-primary">Significance</h1>
            <p class="text-justify">The Donation of Constantine was first cited by Pope Leo in the 11th century
              AD and was used to assert papal power. In the 13th century it was repeatedly
              cited to legitimate the papacy’s claim to land in the west. Territorial
              conflicts and conflicts between the church and secular powers were brewing,
              and the Donation gave the church an edge in debates about who was to rule
              certain territories. Lorenzo Valla’s evidence of the forgery of the donation
              in 15th century AD was initially repressed by the Church, it has since
              become one of the most notorious “pious” forgeries.</p>
