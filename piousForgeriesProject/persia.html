            <h3>Description:</h3>
            <p class="text-justify">The mummy was “encased in a gilded wooden coffin set in a stone sarcophagus” with a hieroglyphic inscription on its chest and was supposed to have been uncovered during an earthquake on the borders of Pakistan, Iran, and Afghanistan. The mummy was crowned with a gold crown embossed with cypress trees and the coffin held gold ornaments. The grandeur of the mummy indicated that it was royal and the cypress trees indicated that it was from the Persian empire. Before the National Museum in Karachi acquired the mummy, it was held in the basement of a black market antiquities dealer in Kharan. The police discovered the museum and transported it to the National Museum in Karachi. The museum’s curators believed they had an enormously important discovery on their hands, which prompted Iran, the Taliban, and Pakistan to attempt to claim the mummy. The mummy was believed to be a princess, a daughter of King Xerxes.</p>

            <h1 class="text-primary">Evidence of Forgery</h1>
            <p class="text-justify">The hieroglyphic inscription on the female mummy’s chest reads “I am the King of this Land” and uses improper grammar. The inscription also includes “ a sizeable chunk lifted straight from a famous inscription of the king Darius (522-486 B.C.) at Behistun in western Iran," which was written after the purported origin date of the mummy. In the inscription, a Greek form of the name was used instead of the Persian form. Other evidence includes the fact that carbon dating shows the wooden coffin to only be 250 years old. Furthermore, the heart was removed from the body, which is not typical of mummies, and the tendons on the corpse were not as decayed as expected by the purported age. The most glaring evidence of forgery was the fact that the mat on which the body of the mummy lay was only five years old. A CT scan revealed that the mummy was a twenty to twenty-one-year-old woman who likely died of a broken spine. In early 2001, the Cultural Heritage Organization of Iran declared the mummy a fake and Pakistan’s National Museum followed suit in April of 2001.

            <p class="text-justify">The mummy was found in the home of a Baluchistan chieftain, Sardar Wali Reeki, who was trying to sell the mummy for thirty-five million pounds. Reeki claims he obtained the mummy from Sharif Shah Bakhi, who found the mummy after an earthquake disturbed the ground in a nearby town.
