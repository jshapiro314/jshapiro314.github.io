            <h3>Description:</h3>
            <p class="text-justify">The Shapira Manuscript is purported to have been found in the late 1860s in caves above the Arnon River in Moab. This manuscript was a set of fifteen leather strips “on which a portion of Deuteronomy was written in a paleo-Hebrew script.” The differences between the accepted version of Deuteronomy and the writing on the Shapira Manuscript potentially indicates that the Shapira Manuscript was a portion of a different version of Deuteronomy. Shapira offered the artifact to the British Museum for one million pounds. While the British Museum investigated the authenticity of the piece, they displayed two of the fragments for the public to view.

            <h3>Purported Time Period:</h3>
            <p class="text-justify">6th century BCE</p>
            <h3>Actual Time Period:</h3>
            <p class="text-justify"> Unknown, but perhaps in the 1880s, when Shapira publicized the Manuscript
</p>
            <h3>Provenance:</h3>
            <p class="text-justify">Shapira owned this piece, attempted to sell it to the British Museum, and then Bernard Quaritch purchased it in 1885.</p>
            <h3>Current Location:</h3>
            <p class="text-justify">Lost in a fire</p>

            <p class="text-justify">The Shapira Manuscript includes the Decalogue, or the Ten Commandments, with several differences, the most important of which is the end of each commandment, “I am God thy God.” Additionally, the Shapira Manuscript adds a different tenth commandment, “Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thy heart.” This is not the only occurrence of a different tenth commandment, but the Shapira Manuscript’s tenth commandment is unique. Furthermore, there is a different seventh commandment and there is no mention of using God’s name in vain. In addition to the differences in the commandments themselves, the Shapira Manuscript has very different spelling compared to other In two letters in 1883, Shapira questions the authenticity of the manuscript but also claims that Dr. Schroeder, German Consul in Beiruth, attested to the authenticity of the manuscript. The Berlin Royal Library, British Museum, and Palestine Exploration Fund all declared the Shapira Manuscript to be a forgery. Before the Shapira Manuscript, Shapira sold the British Museum some sheepskin scrolls with portions cut off, which one scholar claimed to be the origin of the Shapira Manuscript material. 
It was previously thought that leather was not likely to survive as long as the Shapira Manuscript purported to, but the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls has since changed the known lifespan of leather. The Shapira Manuscript has since been lost to a fire, which prevents further study.

            <p class="text-justify">Moses Wilhelm Shapira was an antiquities dealer in Jerusalem who became infamous for his Shapira Manuscript. He was of Polish descent and converted from Judaism to Christianity. He was not well-regarded by scholars, one of whom claimed that Shapira was “a Polish Jew converted to Christianity but not to good works.” Shapira tried to make his big break with this forgery by offering it to the British Museum for one million pounds. The public declaration that the Shapira Manuscript was a forgery drove Shapira to suicide.

            <p class="text-justify">The Shapira Manuscript could have been evidence of another different version of Deuteronomy and might have been one of the first ancient artifacts found near the Dead Sea. There is still some question as to whether or not this piece is a forgery, but the truth will never be known as Wilhelm died by suicide and the scrolls were lost in a fire.
