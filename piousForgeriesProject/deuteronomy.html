            <h3>Description:</h3>
            <p class="text-justify" contenteditable="true">The book of Deuteronomy is the fifth book of the Jewish Torah and the Christian Old Testament. Also known as the “Book of Law”, the text contains a number of sermons delivered by Moses to the Israelites. In these sermons, he sets down a code by which the Israelites must live. Deuteronomy condemns the worship of other gods and regulates the practice of the Jewish faith, centering worship on, “the place, which Yhwh chooses,” assumed to be Jerusalem.</p>
            <h3>Purported Time Period:</h3>
            <p class="text-justify">Late 2nd millennium, early 1st millenium BCE</p>
            <h3>Actual Time Period:</h3>
            <p class="text-justify">7th century BCE</p>
            <h3>Provenance:</h3>
            <p class="text-justify">In 2 Kings 22-23, a “Book of Law” is found in the Temple of Jerusalem
              during renovations under the reign of King Josiah in 622 BCE. The Priest
              Hilkiah is reported to have discovered the book, and called upon the King
              to view it. Scholars believe this is likely a description of the ‘discovery’
              of the book of Deuteronomy. The book was thereafter incorporated into the
              Jewish tradition.</p>
            <h3>Current Location:</h3>
            <p class="text-justify">The Book of Deuteronomy can still be found in all copies of the Jewish
              Torah and the Christian Old Testament. The location of the original “Book
              of Law” found by the priest Hilkiah in 7th Century BCE is unknown.</p>

            <h1 class="text-primary">Evidence of Forgery</h1>
            <p class="text-justify">Biblical scholar W.M.L. De Wette first suggested the dubious nature of
              the book of Deuteronomy in 1805 in his doctoral dissertation. He approached
              the text from both linguistic and historical perspectives to analyze its
              authenticity. The strongest evidence of a post-mosaic authorship are found
              in the text’s departures from the previous four books, and its reference
              to post-mosaic history. De Wette demonstrated that Deuteronomy had a different
              author from the other four books, and contained phrases and language inconsistent
              with the earlier books. Where Deuteronomy did resemble the rest of the
              Pentateuch, it elaborated on short phrases copied from the previous text.
              The language of Deuteronomy is also decidedly not that of the Mosaic period.
              The regulations set forth in Deuteronomy were also very specific to 7th
              century BCE social conditions and problems. Astral worship, prostitution,
              and divorce were problems that were not of concern in the late 2nd millennium
              BCE. Things like child sacrifice, that were allowed practices in the time
              of Moses, were harshly condemned in Deuteronomy. The weight of the evidence
              points very strongly to the document having a 7th century BCE origin.</p>

            <h1 class="text-primary">Profile of Likely Forger</h1>
            <p class="text-justify">The book of Deuteronomy was likely forged by the Priest Hilkiah or another
              person high up in the Temple’s ranks. This may or may not have been completed
              with the permission of King Josiah. Surrounded on all sides by enemies,
              Josiah was in desperate need to organize his empire and centralize power
              in the city of Jerusalem. Both Priests of the Temple and King Josiah would
              benefit from the laws set forth in Deuteronomy.</p>

            <h1 class="text-primary">Significance</h1>
            <p class="text-justify">In the 7th Century CE, the discovery of the book of Deuteronomy enabled
              King Josiah to enact a number of reforms aimed at regulating religious
              worship and practice in Judah. The reforms focused on abolition of the
              astral cult, centralization of worship in Jerusalem, removal of prostitutes
              and necromancers, prohibition of child sacrifice, and the celebration of
              Passover in Jerusalem. These measures enabled Josiah to amass political
              power and exercise control over his people. The Temple in Jerusalem also
              became powerful and wealthy, as the new center of worship. Though De Wette’s
              analysis in 1805 revealed Deuteronomy’s later origins, many adherents to
              the text rejected his analysis. The controversy over the legitimacy of
              Deuteronomy played into 19th century conflict and developments in biblical
              archaeology.</p>
