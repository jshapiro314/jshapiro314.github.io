            <h3>Description:</h3>
            <p class="text-justify">The stone purports to have been created by vikings exploring the Minnesota territory in 14th century AD, documenting the course of their journey. It describes an event in which 10 of their men are killed, presumably by Native Americans.</p>
            <h3>Purported Time Period:</h3>
            <p class="text-justify">1362 AD</p>
            <h3>Actual Time Period:</h3>
            <p class="text-justify">19th century AD</p>
            <h3>Provenance:</h3>
            <p class="text-justify">The stone was discovered by Swedish immigrant and farmer Olof Ohman in 1898 while cutting down trees on his farm in Kensington, Minnesota.</p>
            <h3>Current Location:</h3>
            <p class="text-justify">The Runestone Museum in Alexandria, Minnesota</p>

            <p class="text-justify">The Runestone, soon after its discovery in the 19th century, was denounced by scholars as a forgery, and a poor one at that. Historical knowledge of the vikings made it highly improbable that they would have ended up in Minnesota in the 14th century AD, but scholars still subjected the stone to their typical analyses to determine its authenticity. The inscription on the Runestone contained runic characters in a mix of the Swedish, Norwegian, and English languages, and not the Norse language vikings would have used. The use of numbers, grammar, and vocabulary were all inconsistent with what would be expected if it were authentic. This was enough for the scholarly community to widely declare it to be a forgery.

            <h1 class="text-primary">Profile of Likely Forger</h1>
            <p class="text-justify">The Kensington Runestone was probably created by Olof Ohman, ‘discoverer’ of the stone, with the assistance of his brother-in-law Andrew Anderson, and another neighbor named Sven Fogelbad. Olof Ohman was a Swedish immigrant living in an area heavily populated with recent immigrants from Norway and Sweden, all looking to stake their claim in America. Though the three Minnesotan neighbors may have appeared as simple farm people to the public, research conducted by Theodore Blegen in 1968 showed that, among them, the men had a decent knowledge of runic writings and swedish history, and had a desire to agitate the current order.

            <h1 class="text-primary">Significance</h1>
            <p class="text-justify">In spite of its rapid dismissal as a forgery, the Kensington Runestone has gripped the public for years and played a major role in Minnesota history. The desire for Minnesotans, particularly Scandinavian immigrant populations to see their own personal history interwoven with American history has contributed to the staying power of this artifact. There is even a “Runestone Pageant Play” which dramatizes the events of the stone’s creation and discovery. The myth of the viking foundation of Minnesota is so ingrained that the state’s football team is called the Vikings. The Runestone’s perseverance in Minnesota culture makes the artifact one of the most interesting recent forgeries.
